Just a practice run. I'm following a video tutorial, 100x more slowly than I would follow a text-based tutorial with illustrations. Beginner's curse is that all the readily available, up-to-date teaching material is a) video-based (and thus slow-moving), and b) targeted at beginners (and thus even slower-moving). The net result of which is that beginners stay beginners for too long. |Rant over.
